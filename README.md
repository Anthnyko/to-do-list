# 📝 To-Do List CLI Manager

A simple Java-based command-line application that allows users to manage a dynamic list of chores and tasks. Designed to reinforce object-oriented programming and modular design principles.

## 🚀 Features

- Add new tasks with custom descriptions  
- View all tasks in a clean list format  
- Mark tasks as completed  
- Menu-driven CLI interface for intuitive navigation  

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Java (JDK 17+)  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)  

## 📁 Project Structure
```
src/ 
├── List.java # Handles task list logic
├── Menu.java # Manages user input and menu navigation
└── Tasks.java # Represents individual tasks 
```
## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure Java is installed:
```bash
javac -version
```
2. Compile the project:

```bash
javac src/*.java
```
3. Run the program:
```bash
java src.Menu
```

## 📌 Future Improvements:

- Save/load tasks from a file
- Add due dates and priority levels
- GUI version using JavaFX or Swing
- Unit tests for core functionality

## 📚 What I Learned:

- Building a modular CLI application using Java
- Applying OOP principles to real-world logic
- Structuring code for readability and maintainability
- Handling user input and dynamic task management
